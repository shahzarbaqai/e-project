            <b style="font-size: 30px;">Measles- Year 1846</b>  <br> <br>Measles spread worldwide from the Renaissance. Its epidemiology was remarkably studied in 1846 by a Danish physician, Peter Panum, during an epidemic in the Faroe Islands. The viral nature of this disease was demonstrated in 1911 and the virus was identified in 1954 by Thomas Peebles and John Enders.</p>

Between 1979 and 1994, no cases or outbreaks were detected. However, since 1994, outbreaks have been recognised with increasing frequency. <br>
            Ebolaviruses were first described in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, ebolaviruses have emerged periodically and infected people in several African countries.
